## Instructions on Running on Windows 11

I encountered problems when running the examples on a Windows machine because of the the `make` command. Luckily there is a way around this!

> ‚ùó **DO FIRST:** follow the _Instructions to Reproduce_ from the README section

1. Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
3. Launch PowerShell as Administrator (right-click then select _"Run as Administrator"_), and run:

```bash
choco install make
choco install wget
npm install touch-cli -g
```

**_(Optional)_** make sure the paths are correctly specified in the `Makefile`. You might need to change "/" to "\". The `Makefile` in this fork has the paths corrected for Windows 11
